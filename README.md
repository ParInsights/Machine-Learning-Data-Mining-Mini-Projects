# Machine Learning & Data Mining Mini Projects
This is my repo of a handful of mini projects related to machine learning and data mining concepts. Here you will see a demonstation of a variety of data analytics concepts like a supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and sentiment classifcation. 


1. [Data Exploration and Mining Mini-Project](https://github.com/ParInsights/Machine-Learning-Data-Mining-Mini-Projects/blob/master/1.%20Data%20Mining%20Mathematics%20Curriculum/Final%20Report_MathematicsCurriculum%20.pdf)

A town in New Mexico has decided to initiate a slow rollout of its new high school mathematics curriculum. What started out as a simple idea proposed by a student running for Student Body President in one of the town’s five high school, has turned into a widely petitioned initiative which majority of the town’s residents support. A survey conducted by the school board on the matter showed that 80% of the town’s residents believed that “mathematics was an important life skill”. However, interestingly, only 40% of them felt “confident in their math ability”. Additionally, majority of the towns recent high school graduates felt that “school did not adequately prepare them for life after graduation”.

Therefore, this past fall, the school board voted to allow a standard, single-semester pilot course to take place in all five of the town’s high schools. This new mathematics course will have 35-lessons and will incorporate technology to introduce students to common mathematics software’s and programming languages. With a focus on developing core math skillsets, rather having a primary grade-based focus through homework and reading assignments, this new mathematics course’s goal is to aid student development by including real-world applications.

With 3⁄4 of the semester completed, the school board is trying to understand where the new mathematics classes stand in relation to the originally planned curriculum. The results of this data analysis will help them understand if the curriculum needs to be shortened or condensed even further. Additionally, it will also help them understand which schools in their district have students that are more open to participating in classes that follow a new mathematics curriculum.

2. [Loan Prediction: Association Rules to Predict PEP Request](https://github.com/ParInsights/Machine-Learning-Data-Mining-Mini-Projects/blob/master/2.Loan%20Prediction-Association%20Rules%20to%20Predict%20PEP%20Request/Final%20Report_Loan%20Prediction-Association%20Rules%20to%20Predict%20PEP%20Request.pdf)

Personal Equity Plans (PEP) is a tax-free investment plan that allows those over the age of 18 to invest shares in companies. The overall goal of the plan is the encourage individual investment, through an approved plan and investment trust. One of the main incentives of choosing this investment path was that PEP garner higher capital growth at a greater rate than many other forms of investment.
To determine if a banks customer will want to obtain a PEP, exploration of the bank dataset must occur. This dataset contains attributes related to each person’s demographic and banking information. By running Association Rules on the bank dataset, we can better predict which customers will want to obtain a PEP. Specifically, we will utilize an algorithm to find relationships among the variables by finding how often (frequent) a combination of items appears in the data. The frequent combinations in the data are called rules. By finding the rules from data, we can create reliable predictions that will ultimately help us better serve our customers and expand our network of buyers.


3. [Lie Detector: Can Machine Learning Detect The Lie](https://github.com/ParInsights/Machine-Learning-Data-Mining-Mini-Projects/blob/master/3.%20Lie%20Detection%20-%20Multinomial%20Naive%20Bayes%20%26%20SVM%20(Sentiment%20Classification)/Lie%20Detection-%20Through%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20and%20Multinomial%20%20Naive%20Bayes.pdf)

We will test this claim by analyzing  customer reviews through the use of  Support      Vector Machine and Multinomial  Naive Bayes in order see if we can detect the fake reviews.
