# Machine Learning & Data Mining Mini Projects
This is my repo of a handful of mini projects related to machine learning and data mining concepts. Here you will see a demonstation of a variety of data analytics concepts like a supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and sentiment classifcation. 


1. Data Exploration and Mining Mini-Project 

2. Loan Prediction: Association Rules to Predict PEP Request

3. [Lie Detector: Can Machine Learning Detect The Lie](https://github.com/ParInsights/Machine-Learning-Data-Mining-Mini-Projects/blob/master/3.%20Lie%20Detection%20-%20Multinomial%20Naive%20Bayes%20%26%20SVM%20(Sentiment%20Classification)/Lie%20Detection-%20Through%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20and%20Multinomial%20%20Naive%20Bayes.pdf)

We will test this claim by analyzing  customer reviews through the use of  Support      Vector Machine and Multinomial  Naive Bayes in order see if we can detect the fake reviews.
