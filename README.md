# Machine Learning & Data Mining Mini Projects
This is my repo of a handful of mini projects related to machine learning and data mining concepts. Here you will see a demonstation of a variety of data analytics concepts like a supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and sentiment classifcation. 


1. [Data Exploration and Mining Mini-Project](https://github.com/ParInsights/Machine-Learning-Data-Mining-Mini-Projects/blob/master/1.%20Data%20Mining%20Mathematics%20Curriculum/Final%20Report_MathematicsCurriculum%20.pdf)

2. [Loan Prediction: Association Rules to Predict PEP Request](https://github.com/ParInsights/Machine-Learning-Data-Mining-Mini-Projects/blob/master/2.Loan%20Prediction-Association%20Rules%20to%20Predict%20PEP%20Request/Final%20Report_Loan%20Prediction-Association%20Rules%20to%20Predict%20PEP%20Request.pdf)

Personal Equity Plans (PEP) is a tax-free investment plan that allows those over the age of 18 to invest shares in companies. The overall goal of the plan is the encourage individual investment, through an approved plan and investment trust. One of the main incentives of choosing this investment path was that PEP garner higher capital growth at a greater rate than many other forms of investment.
To determine if a banks customer will want to obtain a PEP, exploration of the bank dataset must occur. This dataset contains attributes related to each personâ€™s demographic and banking information. By running Association Rules on the bank dataset, we can better predict which customers will want to obtain a PEP. Specifically, we will utilize an algorithm to find relationships among the variables by finding how often (frequent) a combination of items appears in the data. The frequent combinations in the data are called rules. By finding the rules from data, we can create reliable predictions that will ultimately help us better serve our customers and expand our network of buyers.


3. [Lie Detector: Can Machine Learning Detect The Lie](https://github.com/ParInsights/Machine-Learning-Data-Mining-Mini-Projects/blob/master/3.%20Lie%20Detection%20-%20Multinomial%20Naive%20Bayes%20%26%20SVM%20(Sentiment%20Classification)/Lie%20Detection-%20Through%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20and%20Multinomial%20%20Naive%20Bayes.pdf)

We will test this claim by analyzing  customer reviews through the use of  Support      Vector Machine and Multinomial  Naive Bayes in order see if we can detect the fake reviews.
